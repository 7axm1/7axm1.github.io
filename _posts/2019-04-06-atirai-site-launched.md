Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together with help of [Jonathan McGlone's guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). 
Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts.
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
